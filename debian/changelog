bsign (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reopened project after long hiatus.  Need identified to use it, so
    there's a need to complete the work.  Shouldn't be too difficult since
    the signing has always worked.  It's UI polish that was missing. 
  * Fixed handling of temporary files and signals so that no temporaries
    are left behind.
  * Fixed the dup_status function so that setuid bit isn't cleared.
  * Added fts_ enumeration mode and unified all of the enumeration into a
    class. 
  * Made some changes to the file processing to avoid mmap'ing files until
    we know that we will be reading the whole file.
  * No longer resigning by default.
  * Summary option.
  * Rewrote man page to reflect new options and to be more clear. 
  * Added scripts to demonstrate use on productionsystem.
  * Improved the handling of informational messages and exit codes so that
    email of output is useful.
  * Changed semantics of command line to be more obvious.  The problem was
    that the switches were interpreted in order.  If a filename appeared
    before the command, bsign wouldn't know what command to execute.  Now,
    all options are read before starting work.
  * Fixed the replace_file function so that there is no opportunity to
    lose a file.
