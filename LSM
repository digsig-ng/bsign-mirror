Title:          bsign - embed hash and signature in elf executables
Version:	<<version>>
Entered-date:	<<date>>
Description:    The purpose of bsign is to verify and authenticate
		data files, especially executables.  It rewrites ELF
		executables, embedding a segment with a hash and
		perhaps a signature.  The original motive for
		developing bsign was to discover files corrupted by
		faulty computer hardware.  The authentication feature
		was an obvious enhancement.
Keywords:       GPG SHA1 embedded hash digital signature ELF
